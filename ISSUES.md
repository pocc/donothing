## Features

### Soon

* [ ] Output tabular data, and update it on every question
* [ ] If there are items under a list item, that item should be treated as a category and skipped
* [ ] Have a reminder feature for the next time you do this same task in this task list
    Something like (Reminder from {date}: {reminder})
* [ ] Have a stats keyword to show you how many times you've done each gradualist before

### Later

* [ ] If you've done this task more than once, provide statistics of how fast you did this compared to last time (i.e. 50% faster than mean)
* [ ] Add the ability to gradualist to suspend a list and save progress. This will mean on the
    command line that you will need to have an option for listing past suspended sessions
    as well as resuming past suspended sessions
* [ ] Save temp files to temp folder
* [ ] Add log [f]eeling
* [ ] Turn this into an interactive website

### Someday

* [ ] Get visual studio to recognize getch.getch()
* [ ] Separate logic for input, output, and processing => (maybe at same time as conversion to different language?)
    * Set script variables like timeout, or autofinish after a certain time
